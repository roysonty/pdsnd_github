### Project Title
Bikeshare

### Description
This project, I make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington, specifically to uncover bike share usage patterns.

### Files used
The three city dataset files chicago csv, new_york_city csv and washington csv are used.

###The Datasets
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:
Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57) End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53) Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776) Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave) End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave) User Type (Subscriber or Customer)


###Analytics tools
Python and excel are utilized.
